# OPTI683---CX-PLP-tidy-up-1---Mobile-Image-Grid---live-8-10-24

GIVEN
i am a user on PLP (and/or SRP) on a Mobile device
 
WHEN
i see the product grid
 
THEN
The images within the grid are now slightly larger in size because there is reduced padding around the images, as per specs (see UI)
 
Consideration – this view remains consistent even when user sorts/re-sorts/filters/views more on the page
